  - Docker Compose orchestration for voice services
  - Modular architecture: browser → WebSocket → Python backend
- **Agent Core (Epic 3) complete**:
  - Claude Agent SDK integration (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`)
  - In-process MCP server via `createSdkMcpServer()` (zero subprocess overhead)
  - `IrisAgent` class with streaming `chat()` and `chatComplete()` methods
  - IRIS system prompt with voice-optimized personality
  - Dynamic user context injection from memory

  - MCP tools: 11 tools aligned with Anthropic memory server
  - Conversation TTL (48h default, cleanup job)
  - User edit tracking ("remember that..." requests)
  - Prose summaries with staleness detection
  - 12 unit tests passing
  - Pattern extracted to agentic-framework: `patterns/sqlite-knowledge-graph.md`
- Monorepo initialized with pnpm workspaces (5 packages)
- MCP Server Foundation (Feature 1.1) complete:
  - TypeScript + MCP SDK setup
  - Server lifecycle handlers (connect, shutdown)
  - Tool registration framework with error handling
  - First tool: `getWalletBalance` (Solana)
- Solana Blockchain Tools (Feature 1.2) complete:
  - `getTransactionHistory` tool with pagination support
  - Transaction type inference (SOL/token transfers, program interactions)
  - MVP scope refined (prepareTransaction deferred)
- Star Atlas Fleet Tools (Feature 1.3) complete:
  - `getFleetStatus` MVP: player profile verification
  - `predictFuelDepletion`: fuel status and recommendations
  - SAGE SDK spike needed for auto-fetch fleet data

**Completed (2025-12-01):**
- Vision alignment session (docs/planning-session-2025-11-12.md)
- Architecture pivot: AWS -> Digital Ocean VPS
- Memory architecture simplified to SQLite (pip-by-arc-forge pattern)
- Voice service updated to use Chatterbox (self-hosted STT/TTS)

**In Progress:**
- 🟢 **Voice Integration** (2025-12-02):
  - ✅ STT (faster-whisper) - **WORKING** - transcribes voice to text
  - ✅ WebSocket bridge - audio streaming from browser functional
  - ✅ Push-to-talk UI - recording and sending audio
  - ✅ TTS (Chatterbox) - **WORKING** - synthesizes speech from text
  - ✅ Response conciseness - max 2 sentences for TTS
  - ✅ Duplicate response bug - fixed (skip assistant messages, use stream_event deltas)
  - Note: Running locally (not Docker) with `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""`
  - Note: Chatterbox model ~3GB cached in ~/.cache/huggingface/

- 🟡 **Integration Testing** (2025-12-02):
  - ✅ Agent API (port 3001) - working, tested chat endpoint
  - ✅ Web App (port 3002) - serving, chat interface functional
  - ✅ Voice backend (port 8001) - STT working on CPU
  - ✅ Voice WebSocket (port 8002) - audio streaming works
  - ✅ Dockerfiles fixed (UID 1000 conflict resolved)
  - Branding: "guy in the chair" personality

- 🟡 **ARCH-001**: IRIS/CITADEL separation - decision made (2025-12-02)
  - MCP tools **stay in IRIS** (wrap Citadel REST API)
  - Citadel provides REST + WebSocket only
  - BLOCKED: Waiting for Citadel REST API (Epic 2-3)

**Next Up (MVP scope):**
- [x] **Voice conciseness**: IRIS responses max 2 sentences for TTS
- [x] **TTS testing**: Chatterbox voice synthesis working
- [ ] **End-to-end voice testing**: Test full voice conversation loop
- [ ] CITADEL: REST API for blockchain/game data (separate repo)

**Deferred from MVP (2025-12-02):**
- ⏸️ `prepareTransaction` tool - users execute via Star Atlas UI
- ⏸️ `subscribeToFleetUpdates` WebSocket - use polling instead
- ⏸️ Latency optimization - measure first, optimize post-MVP
- ⏸️ CITADEL Integration (Epic 8) - entire epic is post-MVP
- ⏸️ CI/CD pipelines - main-only workflow, deploy via docker-compose

## Open Questions

**Resolved:**
1. ~~Architecture?~~ -> VPS + SQLite (Digital Ocean, pip-by-arc-forge pattern)
2. ~~Price monitoring?~~ -> Secondary feature (context for AI, not charting)
3. ~~Target users?~~ -> Multi-user SaaS
4. ~~Personality progression?~~ -> DEFERRED (focus on robust memory first)
5. ~~Infrastructure?~~ -> Existing DO VPS (640MB+ RAM available)
6. ~~Voice processing?~~ -> Chatterbox (self-hosted, $0/month)
7. ~~Voice UX?~~ -> Push-to-talk for MVP

**Still pending:**
1. **Authentication flow**: Magic link vs wallet-first? (Lean: email-first)
2. **Subscription tiers**: Decide after MVP validation

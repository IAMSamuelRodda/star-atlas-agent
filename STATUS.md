## Current Focus

**Completed (2025-12-01):**
- Vision alignment session (docs/planning-session-2025-11-12.md)
- Archive mining: galactic-data wisdom extracted
- Competitive analysis: EvEye feature comparison
- **Architecture pivot**: AWS -> Digital Ocean VPS
- **Personality progression DEFERRED** (focus on robust memory first)
- Memory architecture simplified to SQLite (pip-by-arc-forge pattern)
- Voice service updated to use Chatterbox (self-hosted STT/TTS)

**In Progress:**
- Project documentation refresh
- Simple git workflow setup

**Next Up:**
- [ ] Create GitHub issues for MVP implementation
- [ ] Begin implementation (MCP server first)

## Recent Achievements (Last 2 Weeks)

**Architecture Refresh (2025-12-01)**
- Migrated from AWS to Digital Ocean VPS (cost-predictable)
- Deferred personality progression (colleague -> partner -> friend)
- Adopted pip-by-arc-forge pattern (SQLite + Node.js)
- Updated to Chatterbox for self-hosted voice ($0/month)

**Vision & Planning Session (2025-11-12)**
- Established multi-user SaaS scope with voice-first interface
- Documented strategic differentiation from EvEye (AI insights vs data viz)
- Extracted wisdom from galactic-data archives (Solana integration patterns)

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Simple Git Workflow** (Worktree-based)
   - **main** branch only in primary directory
   - **Worktrees** for parallel development (NOT branch switching)
   - GitHub Issues for task tracking
   - No complex project boards

2. **Begin Implementation**
   - MCP server first (Solana + Star Atlas data access)
   - Memory service (SQLite, simple schema)
   - Agent core (Claude Agent SDK integration)
   - Voice service (Chatterbox STT/TTS)
   - Web app (React + Vite frontend)

## Open Questions

**Resolved:**
1. ~~Architecture?~~ -> VPS + SQLite (Digital Ocean, pip-by-arc-forge pattern)
2. ~~Price monitoring?~~ -> Secondary feature (context for AI, not charting)
3. ~~Target users?~~ -> Multi-user SaaS
4. ~~Personality progression?~~ -> DEFERRED (focus on robust memory first)
5. ~~Infrastructure?~~ -> Existing DO VPS (640MB+ RAM available)
6. ~~Voice processing?~~ -> Chatterbox (self-hosted, $0/month)
7. ~~Voice UX?~~ -> Push-to-talk for MVP

**Still pending:**
1. **Authentication flow**: Magic link vs wallet-first? (Lean: email-first)
2. **Subscription tiers**: Decide after MVP validation

**Note**: Archive items older than 2 weeks to keep document focused.

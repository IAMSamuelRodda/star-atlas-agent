## Current Focus

**Completed Today/This Week:**
-  Vision alignment session (docs/planning-session-2025-11-12.md)
-  Archive mining: galactic-data wisdom extracted
-  Competitive analysis: EvEye feature comparison
-  AWS Free Tier constraints documented (serverless + DynamoDB pattern)
-  Base documentation structure initialized (CLAUDE.md, README.md, STATUS.md)
- âœ… Persistent memory architecture researched (DynamoDB vector store for RAG)
- âœ… Personalization requirements defined (colleague â†’ partner â†’ friend progression)
- âœ… Trust-building visualization strategy documented

**In Progress:**
- =5 ARCHITECTURE.md creation (pending)
- =5 CONTRIBUTING.md creation (pending)
- =5 DEVELOPMENT.md creation (pending)
- =5 CHANGELOG.md creation (pending)

**Next Up:**
- [ ] Complete base documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] Generate BLUEPRINT.yaml using `blueprint-planner` subagent
- [ ] Validate complexity with `improving-plans` skill
- [ ] Create GitHub issues using `github-project-infrastructure` skill
- [ ] Begin implementation (MCP server first)

## Recent Achievements (Last 2 Weeks)

**Vision & Planning Session** 
- Completed: 2025-11-12
- Established multi-user SaaS scope with voice-first interface
- Defined AWS Free Tier architecture (<$10/month MVP)
- Documented strategic differentiation from EvEye (AI insights vs data viz)
- Extracted wisdom from galactic-data archives (Solana integration patterns)

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Complete Base Documentation**
   - ARCHITECTURE.md with tech stack, database schema, ADRs
   - CONTRIBUTING.md with GitHub workflow
   - DEVELOPMENT.md with git branching, pre-commit checklist
   - CHANGELOG.md with Keep a Changelog format

2. **Generate Project Blueprint**
   - Use `blueprint-planner` subagent to create specs/BLUEPRINT.yaml
   - Validate complexity with `improving-plans` skill
   - Ensure AI-adjusted timeline estimates (20x human speedup)

3. **Set Up GitHub Infrastructure**
   - Create GitHub issues from blueprint
   - Configure project boards
   - Set up branch protection rules (dev ’ main only)
   - Initialize CI/CD workflows

4. **Begin Implementation**
   - MCP server first (Solana + Star Atlas data access)
   - Agent core (Claude Agent SDK integration)
   - Voice service (WebRTC + Whisper + ElevenLabs)
   - Web app (React + Vite frontend)

## Open Questions

**Resolved during planning:**
1. ~~Architecture pattern?~~ ’ Serverless + DynamoDB (AWS Free Tier)
2. ~~Price monitoring strategy?~~ ’ Secondary feature (context for AI, not charting)
3. ~~Target users?~~ ’ Multi-user SaaS

**Still pending:**
1. **Voice UX**: Push-to-talk vs always-listening? (Recommend PTT for MVP - simpler, lower cost)
2. **Authentication**: Wallet-based (Solana) vs traditional (email)? (Recommend both - wallet for on-chain, email for notifications)
3. **Subscription tiers**: Free tier limits? (Recommend: Free = 5 fleets, Pro = unlimited)
4. **Market data frequency**: How often refresh prices? (Recommend: 5-min like EvEye for MVP)
5. **Alert delivery**: Voice-only vs also push notifications/email? (Recommend: Multi-channel for MVP)

**Decision point**: Resolve during blueprint creation or defer to implementation?

## Current Focus

**Completed (2025-12-02):**
- **Memory Service (Epic 2) complete**:
  - SQLite knowledge graph (entities, observations, relations)
  - MCP tools: 11 tools aligned with Anthropic memory server
  - Conversation TTL (48h default, cleanup job)
  - User edit tracking ("remember that..." requests)
  - Prose summaries with staleness detection
  - 12 unit tests passing
  - Pattern extracted to agentic-framework: `patterns/sqlite-knowledge-graph.md`
- Monorepo initialized with pnpm workspaces (5 packages)
- MCP Server Foundation (Feature 1.1) complete:
  - TypeScript + MCP SDK setup
  - Server lifecycle handlers (connect, shutdown)
  - Tool registration framework with error handling
  - First tool: `getWalletBalance` (Solana)
- Solana Blockchain Tools (Feature 1.2) complete:
  - `getTransactionHistory` tool with pagination support
  - Transaction type inference (SOL/token transfers, program interactions)
  - MVP scope refined (prepareTransaction deferred)
- Star Atlas Fleet Tools (Feature 1.3) complete:
  - `getFleetStatus` MVP: player profile verification
  - `predictFuelDepletion`: fuel status and recommendations
  - SAGE SDK spike needed for auto-fetch fleet data

**Completed (2025-12-01):**
- Vision alignment session (docs/planning-session-2025-11-12.md)
- Architecture pivot: AWS -> Digital Ocean VPS
- Memory architecture simplified to SQLite (pip-by-arc-forge pattern)
- Voice service updated to use Chatterbox (self-hosted STT/TTS)

**In Progress:**
- 🟡 **ARCH-001**: IRIS/CITADEL separation - decision made (2025-12-02)
  - MCP tools **stay in IRIS** (wrap Citadel REST API)
  - Citadel provides REST + WebSocket only
  - BLOCKED: Waiting for Citadel REST API (Epic 2-3)

**Next Up (MVP scope):**
- [ ] **Agent Core (Epic 3)**: Claude Agent SDK integration, session management
- [ ] **Voice Service (Epic 4)**: Chatterbox STT/TTS (needs spike first)
- [ ] Web App (Epic 5): React + Vite frontend
- [ ] CITADEL: REST API for blockchain/game data (Epic 2-3)
- [ ] IRIS: Update MCP tools to wrap Citadel REST (Epic 8, blocked)

**Deferred from MVP (2025-12-02):**
- ⏸️ `prepareTransaction` tool - users execute via Star Atlas UI
- ⏸️ `subscribeToFleetUpdates` WebSocket - use polling instead
- ⏸️ Latency optimization - measure first, optimize post-MVP
- ⏸️ CITADEL Integration (Epic 8) - entire epic is post-MVP
- ⏸️ CI/CD pipelines - main-only workflow, deploy via docker-compose

## Recent Achievements (Last 2 Weeks)

**Architecture Refresh (2025-12-01)**
- Migrated from AWS to Digital Ocean VPS (cost-predictable)
- Deferred personality progression (colleague -> partner -> friend)
- Adopted pip-by-arc-forge pattern (SQLite + Node.js)
- Updated to Chatterbox for self-hosted voice ($0/month)

**Vision & Planning Session (2025-11-12)**
- Established multi-user SaaS scope with voice-first interface
- Documented strategic differentiation from EvEye (AI insights vs data viz)
- Extracted wisdom from galactic-data archives (Solana integration patterns)

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. ✅ **Simple Git Workflow** (Complete 2025-12-02)
   - `main` only, no branch protection
   - Worktrees for parallel agent work
   - See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for workflow

2. ✅ **Memory Service** (Complete 2025-12-02)
   - SQLite knowledge graph with MCP tools
   - Pattern extracted to agentic-framework

3. **Agent Core (Epic 3)** - Next
   - Claude Agent SDK integration
   - Session management
   - System prompt + memory injection

## Open Questions

**Resolved:**
1. ~~Architecture?~~ -> VPS + SQLite (Digital Ocean, pip-by-arc-forge pattern)
2. ~~Price monitoring?~~ -> Secondary feature (context for AI, not charting)
3. ~~Target users?~~ -> Multi-user SaaS
4. ~~Personality progression?~~ -> DEFERRED (focus on robust memory first)
5. ~~Infrastructure?~~ -> Existing DO VPS (640MB+ RAM available)
6. ~~Voice processing?~~ -> Chatterbox (self-hosted, $0/month)
7. ~~Voice UX?~~ -> Push-to-talk for MVP

**Still pending:**
1. **Authentication flow**: Magic link vs wallet-first? (Lean: email-first)
2. **Subscription tiers**: Decide after MVP validation
